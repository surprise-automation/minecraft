# Dockerized Spigot Minecraft

Status: Untested, unbuilt

Builds the spigot.mc jar for you and spins up a minecraft server with it.

## Infos

CentOS based container. Builds OpenJDK-16.0.2 from source, pulls down BuildTools and builds spigot.mc for you.

No need for a start script; just used an endpoint to achieve the exact same thing.

## Build & Run

I haven't released this on Docker Hub yet. 

```
docker build . -t mc_spigot:latest
docker run --name my_mc_server -p 25565:25565/tcp mc_spigot:latest
## If on RH
#firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=25565/tcp
#firewall-cmd --reload
## If on Deb
#ufw allow 25565/tcp
```

## Extended to run a central repo of jars

If you're running a host or whatever you can just map /jar/ to a folder containing your binaries. It will run whatever jar is called `/jar/minecraft_server_1.17.1.jar`.
